# Yaml widgets for BGP flow route data extraction
# - FlowRoutesTable extracts 'show route table inetflow.0 extensive'
#    and rt-prefix-length variables are used as class keys()
#    in format 'term:1' etc.
# - FlowRoutesView identifies most relevant fields
#    including destination as NLRI composition, age and action
